# OpenCorrï¼š An open source C++ library for digital image correlation 

OpenCorr is an open source C++ library for development of 2D, 3D/stereo, and volumetric digital image correlation (DIC). It aims to provide a developer-friendly, lightweight, and efficient kit to the users who are willing to study the state-of-the-art algorithms of DIC and DVC (digital volume correlation), or to create DIC/DVC programs for their specific applications.

OpenCorr is under construction. More functions, including the GPU accelerated modules will be released soon. Thus, update of both codes and webpages will be frequent in the following months until we reach a stable version with relatively complete documentation.

Comments and suggestions are most welcome. You may reach us via
